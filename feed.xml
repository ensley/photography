It’s a long drive, so we decided to make a little vacation out of it. The Pelletiers were renting a lovely lake house nearby for the weekend, and we stayed there for a couple nights playing lots of card games (as usual). On Monday, they went back home and we continued even further north to Acadia. Gwen and Nate came along too, and we stayed in a nice little Airbnb cabin in a small town about half an hour from the park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though peak tourist season was fast approaching, there was lots of construction around Bar Harbor. We had to take a long detour along basically the only other road on the island to get into town, but we didn’t mind too much. It’s a pretty drive, and it’s not like we were in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the rest of the week in Bar Harbor and the park, eating lobster and ice cream, drinking wine, and hiking. We drove up Cadillac Mountain and admired the view, and we climbed up the Beehive, which looks daunting but is made easy by lots of steel bars drilled into the rock face.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>John Ensley</name></author><summary type="html">In the spring of 2017, we took a trip up to Portland, ME for Gwendolyn’s graduation ceremony.
